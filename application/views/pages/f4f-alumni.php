                <h3>About the Business</h3>
                <p>Pemnia wellness is a registered enterprise which specializes in the processing of high quality and
                    nutritious biofortified orange fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) into Vita Crisps, Vita Meal, Vita Garri
                    and Vita Flour for the domestic and export markets. OFSP is a source of pro-vitamin A which supply
                    up to 100% daily intake of vitamin A and has been shown to increase children's vitamin A status and
                    shorten the probability and duration of diarrhea.

                    Orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) contains high levels of beta-carotene, which is converted by the
                    body into vitamin A. Just 125g of boiled OFSP can provide the recommended daily allowance of vitamin
                    A for children and women. In addition, OFSP contributes significant amounts of vitamins C, E and
                    several B vitamins, as well as dietary fiber, iron and magnesium.

                    Our purpose is to make an impact throughout the world to solve hidden hunger by scaling up
                    biofortification as a nutrition response and a source of revenue for rural and low-income
                    communities. PEMNIA WELLNESS fills a significant place in the market by offering tasty, handy, and
                    nutrient-dense food options in vitamin A, which is necessary for good growth and immunity.

                <h3>About the Business</h3>
                <p>Quotidian-V Foods (Q-VF) is an agricultural business specializing in beekeeping and the processing
                    and sale of bee-products. Situated in Abeokuta, the capital city of Ogun State, Nigeria, operating
                    under the brand name "BURZ".

                    jelly, Bee venom & Bee Pollen

                    The company began operations in December 2018 with one beehive and five litres of honey. It was
                    officially registered in March 2020, at which point we added fifty more beehives. Therefore, we
                    consider March 2020 our official launch date.

                    In 2019, Q-VF won its first grant as the emerging winner of the first edition of Farmers for the
                    Future Award by The British American Tobacco Nigeria Foundation (BATNF), worth five million naira
                    (in cash and technical support). This grant was used to establish our own farm with 50 beehives and
                    to acquire modern equipment for processing bee products.

                    Since then, Q-VF has received additional grants worth over two million naira from the Federal
                    Government and other private organizations.</p>
